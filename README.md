# 🔍 Log Source Onboarding & Normalization

This repo provides real-world examples of parsing, normalizing, and enriching security logs from common sources:

- ✅ Okta (MFA + login events)
- ☁️ AWS CloudTrail (root use, policy changes)
- 🖥️ Sysmon (process creation, DNS queries)

## 🛠️ Goals
- Normalize fields for use in SIEM or detection pipelines
- Extract high-signal elements (user, IP, method, action)
- Demonstrate log source knowledge beyond Sigma

---

📥 Add your raw log to the folder → run the script → get normalized output.
